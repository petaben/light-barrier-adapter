# light-barrier-adapter

Adapter circuit for these 5 pin [light barriers](https://omronfs.omron.com/en_US/ecb/products/pdf/en-ee_sx3161_w11_4161_w11.pdf).
To make the interface to the light barrier easier and to avoid having 5 cables going to the controller board I use this simple adapter.

This repository contains the PCB design but it's as well easy to make the adapter on a stripboard.
